    "In the code cell below I create a function called `get_data()`. The purpose of this function is to download, clean and save data for the five 'FAANG' stocks for the 5 day period directly preceding the day on which the code is run. The function does that by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using the Panda library's Timestamp function to get the current date and time and then specifying exactly how that should be formatted with `.strftime('%Y%m%d-%H%M%S')` ([Reference](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-behavior))\n",
    "- Creating the file_path variable (where the FAANG data should be saved), and using f strings to make set the file name equal to the current_date_time variable value\n",
    "- Using the yfinance library's `yf.download` function to download stock data for the five day period from the five FAANG stocks ([Reference](https://ranaroussi.github.io/yfinance/reference/yfinance.ticker_tickers.html))\n",
    "- Saving this to a Pandas dataframe, and then importantly, creating a `pd.MultiIndex` object from this. I initially ran into indexing issues when attempting to go from a Dataframe to a CSV file. I researched multi indexing so that I could have the 'Close', 'Open', and 'Volume' headings as index objects above each of the stocks, to improve readability and also to instruct python to properly convert the data frame into a readable csv file ([Reference](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/advanced.html))\n",
    "- Finally I save the dataframe to a csv file using the specified file path, and subsequently return the file path. The reason I return the file path, and then set it equal to the function when I call it (`file_path = get_data()`), is as this both runs the function and stores the file path for use in the next function that I will be using.\n",
